# SayuriHUD
This is a custom HUD for the game Team Fortress 2. As of writing this it is extremely buggy.
I plan on working on this until it is what I would consider my "ideal" HUD as I plan on using something similar in a future project.

To install the HUD you must copy the contents of the package into this directory:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

I find the HUD works well alongside BroeselHUD but it also works as a standalone.
The main issue at the moment is that it only works on monitors running at 1920x1080, so I'll be working on fixing this.
